Welcome to the Email Bombing Software project by Talha Baig Hacker.

## What is a mail bomb?

A mail bomb is a form of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack designed to overwhelm an inbox or inhibit a server by sending a massive number of emails to a specific 
person or system. The aim is to fill up the recipient's disk space on the server or overload a server to stop it from functioning.

Also known as email bombs and letter bombs, mail bombs inconvenience not only the intended target but everyone who uses the server. When a server is unresponsive, 
it can degrade network performance and potentially lead to downtime.

Mail bomb attacks are usually initiated -- intentionally or unintentionally -- by a botnet, a single actor or a group of actors. The damage caused by a mail bomb 
can range from a minor inconvenience to a total disruption of services. Mail bomb attacks can last for several hours if no effort is made to filter, mitigate or 
block the attacking traffic.
